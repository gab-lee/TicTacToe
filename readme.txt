## Context: 
As I prepare for 42 Piscine next year I thought it would be good to learn some C, and what better way to learn than to learn to code a game. 


## Game setup
Board
1|2|3
-+-+-
4|5|6
-+-+-
7|8|9 

## Game sequence
- User makes a move -> if not valid -> User is prompted to make a move till valid
- Display board with user move -> Change to computer's turn
- Random move is generated for the computer -> Check if move is valid -> repeat number generation till move is valid
- At the end of each turn check if game is over (either player wins or no more valid moves)
- Input is always taken as a char for ease of printing. Char can take the form of '1' or 'x' or 'o'.  

## Devlog
- 20251223: I Finished the first version of the game. The game logic works, however the computer you play against is rather dumb.
